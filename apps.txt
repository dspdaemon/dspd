The following client applications were tested and are known to work well.
This means no lagging sound effects or A/V sync issues or distortions.

Quake 3              (SDL/OSS)
Quake 4              (OpenAL/ALSA)
Doom 3 1.3           (ALSA)
Descent 3            (ALSA WINE)
winecfg              (ALSA)
Flash Player         (ALSA)
Xine                 (ALSA,OSS,sndio)
Descent for MS-DOS   (ALSA,OSS Qemu 0.9)
Mozilla Seamonkey    (ALSA)
Firefox              (ALSA)
Chromium Browser     (ALSA)
Chromium BSU         (OSS)
KDE 4.10.5           (ALSA)
aplay/arecord        (ALSA)
ossplay              (OSS)
mplayer              (OSS)
esd		     (ALSA)
fluidsynth   	     (ALSA,OSS)

The following applications mostly work:

aucat                (sndio,ALSA)
 May abort capture on xrun with sndio protocol.  ALSA support requires
 a special pcm.hw entry in .asoundrc to override hardware access.

ossxmix              (OSS)
 Some controls aren't correctly represented due to bugs in dspd.

aumix                (OSS)
 The OSSv3 mixer API sucks.  Maybe it would be better to just represent a small
 number of well known controls such as PCM, MIC, etc. and stop trying
 to represent the actual device.

pulseaudio    	     (ALSA,OSS)
 Works as a client.  Not very well tested and probably won't be as long
 as no apps on my system require pulseaudio.

opera 12       	     (ALSA)
 Seems to work.  HTML5 video has some glitches but this may be due to
 the browser being very old.


Not tested for a while, but previously known to work:

artsd	       	     (ALSA,OSS)
google-chrome	     Nearly identical to Chromium and did previously work.
vlc		     (OSS)
