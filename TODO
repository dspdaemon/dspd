*Improve documentation.  Document all functions and explain them properly
 so that they can be used without studying the source code.

*Finish OSS ioctls

*Improve full duplex device support.  Splitting devices into two
 half duplex devices needs improvement and the full duplex threads
 are buggy.

*ALSA client control support.  Currently only PCM is supported.  It is
 possible to use ALSA and DSPD config files to redirect clients trying
 to access hardware (hw:) and have clients directly access the control
 interface.  It might be better if they just used the daemon instead
 because that makes configuration easier.
